    <p style="color: cyan">
      A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of
      instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages
      are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

    <p style="color: rgb(255, 118, 6)">
      Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There
      are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather
      than general programming languages. Since the early 1800s, programs have
      been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music
      boxes and player pianos.[1] The programs for these machines (such as a
      player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to
      different inputs or conditions.

        being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an
        imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while
        other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is
        specified, not how to achieve it).</strong

      The description of a programming language is usually split into the two
      components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are
      defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming
      language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as
      Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some
      languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and
      extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.
